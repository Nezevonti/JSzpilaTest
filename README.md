# JSzpilaTest

All tests in one project in different classes for convinince.

The SWAPI test uses 3rd party library (SWapi by MYankow)
link : https://github.com/M-Yankov/SWapi-CSharp

I used a 3rd party library as I came to the conclusion
that re-inventing the wheel when it is not needed, and would take more time.
I added my own class (Extended Repository) building on top of mr Yankow work
to add search capability as there wasnt one in his lib (SearchSwAPI).
